== README

This web app is built with Ruby on Rails.
It also has a smidge of jQuery and javascript in there.

It allows users to lookup artists coming to play shows in a city within a timeframe
that the user specifies. The user can then listen to samples of those artists,
select as many as they want and hit generate to have a playlist created and sent
to their Spotify account. The playlist will contain tracks from those artists
they selected.
